Makes whips collisions less discrete by replacing its rectangle-based collision checks with triangle-based ones.
This allows whips to hit small enemies much more consistently than in the vanilla game.
However, the timing of the hitboxes are not as synchronized to the visual movements, especially near the center line of the whip.
